[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2503.23185-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23185)

## Project Note

This repository is based on the original IFRVP implementation by Hirose et al. The original project and paper introduced the IFRVP model for real-time video prediction.

This fork adapts that work for **real-time video prediction for teleoperation and autonomous driving**, with additional training and evaluation scripts for BDD100K-style driving videos, demo fine-tuning workflows, and comparison/verification utilities.

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of "REAL-TIME VIDEO PREDICTION WITH FAST VIDEO INTERPOLATION MODEL AND PREDICTION TRAINING," a novel approach to enable zero-latency interaction in networked video applications.

## Teleoperation / Autonomous Driving Adaptation

This adaptation focuses on predicting near-future driving-scene frames for latency compensation in remote operation and autonomous-driving video pipelines. The added workflow includes:

1. Preprocessing scripts for BDD100K/demo driving videos
2. Training and fine-tuning scripts for future-frame prediction
3. Evaluation utilities for comparing pretrained and fine-tuned IFRVP outputs
4. Verification scripts and demo metrics for presentation/reporting

## Paper Abstract

Transmission latency significantly affects users' quality of experience in real-time interaction and actuation. While latency is fundamentally inevitable due to physical constraints, this work proposes IFRVP (Intermediate Feature Refinement Video Prediction) to mitigate latency through efficient video prediction. IFRVP extends a simple convolution-only frame interpolation network based on IFRNet by unifying optical flow estimation and pixel refinements into a single network. The architecture introduces ELAN-based residual blocks which significantly reduce computational complexity while maintaining high prediction accuracy. Unlike previous state models that require recursive application for multi-frame prediction, IFRVP's arbitrary and independent prediction methods can generate predictions for any future timestep in a single inference, effectively avoiding error accumulation while enabling real-time performance even on consumer hardware.

## Key Contributions

1. **Three Training Methods for Video Prediction**:
   - **Recurrent Prediction**: Uses the two latest frames to recursively predict the next frame
   - **Arbitrary Prediction**: Predicts any future timestep in a single inference using timestep embedding
   - **Independent Prediction**: Utilizes specialized models for different prediction timesteps

2. **ELAN-based Residual Blocks**: Lightweight architecture that improves both inference speed and prediction accuracy

3. **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Achieves the best trade-off between prediction accuracy and computational speed compared to existing methods

## Results

- IFRVP-Fast achieves comparable or better prediction quality than state-of-the-art methods while requiring only 9.9 GFLOPs (20% less computation than DMVFN)
- Models can run at 70-130 FPS on consumer GPUs depending on resolution
- Independent prediction training achieves the highest accuracy by avoiding error accumulation
